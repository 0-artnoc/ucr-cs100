## online communities

Participating in online programming communities is a fun way to expand your programming knowledge.  I want to encourage you to participate.  Here are four ways you can get extra credit from participation:

1. If you have a project on github with more than 10 stars, you will get 10 points extra credit.  Stars from fellow UCR students count as only 1/4 a star.

2. If you have a stackoverflow account with more than 100 points, you will get 10 points extra credit.  If you have a stackoverflow account with more than 1000 points, you will get an *additional* 20 points extra credit.  You do not need to have created the account or earned the points during this quarter.

3. If you submit something to the front page of [/r/programming](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming) that gets more than 200 upvotes, you will get 10 points extra credit.

4. If you submit something to the front page of [hacker news](http://news.ycombinator.com) that gets more than 30 upvotes, you will get 10 points extra credit.
