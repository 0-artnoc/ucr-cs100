This directory contains a selection of videos created by previous cs100 students.

FIXME:
I would like the videos downloaded from youtube and included directly in the repo, possibly using a tool like git-annex.

FIXME:
I dislike that these videos have their own page and are not directly embedded in a more relevant writeup.
