## a local Linux installation

Install Linux on your personal desktop/laptop computer.  I personally use the [Debian](http://www.debian.org/) and [Slackware](http://slackware.org) distributions, but you're free to choose whatever distribution you like.  The lab machines use [CentOS](http://www.centos.org).

There are two ways you can install Linux.  The first is as a dual boot operating system.  Every Linux distribution's installer will walk you through how to do this.  The second option is as a virtual machine inside of your windows/mac computer.  This is a little trickier to set up, but some people find it more convenient.  I don't care which method you choose.

**RECOMENDATION:** Make this a group activity.  Get together with some of your classmates and spend a Saturday installing Linux on everyone's computers.  It will be a lot more fun this way, and you'll be able to help each other out when you get stuck.

### grading

25 points for a fully working Linux installation.  You must install all the tools we will be using in class.

If you installed Linux onto a laptop, bring your laptop to class and I will check you off.  You must have wireless internet working for full credit!  

If you installed Linux onto a desktop machine, then we will ssh into your desktop from the school account.  You must install the ssh daemon and configure your network routing appropriately.

**IMPORTANT:** If you already have Linux installed on one of your machines, you do NOT have to reinstall it for this assignment.  You will get full credit.

**IMPORTANT:** If you do not have a personal computer to install Linux on, see me and I'll work out an alternate assignment.

### extra credit

There is a Linux program called `wine` that lets you run windows programs from Linux.  If you install wine and can use it to run any 3D windows game---I don't care which, you pick---then you will get 5 points of extra credit.
