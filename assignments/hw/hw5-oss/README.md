## contributing to an open source project

### requirements

Improve the course materials on github.

**IMPORTANT:** If you do not want to do this assignment for some reason, that's okay.  You can do the extra credit on the rshell assignment instead.

### submission instructions

You must submit your patch as a pull request through github.  I will evaluate the pull request the same as any other pull request into an open source project.

### testing

I will not merge code that hasn't been thoroughly tested.  Your pull request on github must clearly document why you think the code works and/or what edge cases it will fail on.

### collaboration policy

You are encouraged to work in teams on this assignment.  Teams can be of any size, but a larger team must give a larger contribution.

You MAY freely discuss this assignment with anyone, whether they are on your team or not.

### grading

30 points for the quality of the idea

70 points for your implementation

### extra credit

If you submit your contribution early, then students this quarter will benefit from it.  You can get up to 25 points extra credit from an early submission.
