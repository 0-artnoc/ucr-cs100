# hacker reading

There are a lot of books that have made it into the "hacker culture."  Reading them is a fun way to get better at programming.  I will give you 20 points of extra credit if you read any of the following books and discuss it with me: 


1.  (free) Eliezer Yudkowsky's [Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality](http://hpmor.com)

2.  Any *two* of Terry Pratchett's *Diskworld* novels.

3.  Douglas Hofstadter's *GÃ¶del, Escher, and Bach*.

4.  Peter Seibel's *Coders at Work*

5.  Jessica Livingston's *Founders at Work*. 

You may also suggest another book that you think has hacker value.  If I agree, I'll add it to the list.

**IMPORTANT:** If you've already read one of these books, that doesn't count.  Read a different one.
